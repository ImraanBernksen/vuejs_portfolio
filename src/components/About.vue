          <p class="lead text-dark about-par">
            I'm 20 years old and born in Cape Town, South Africa. I'm a IT student at Life Choices Academy amd want to have a job in software development in the future. Graduated from Oaklands Highschool in 2020 then, after I did some online courses. I'm very mature for my age, friendly and hardworking. I've
            always been interested in technology (phones and computers) and computer literate.
            I enjoy interacting and work with people. One of my most important attributes is
            responsibility, I appreciate being depended on and trustworthy. I will always go the
            extra mile and be helpful where I can.
