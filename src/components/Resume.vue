          <h4>Interests</h4>
          <p class="lead text-dark mx-5">
            My interests are coding, listening to music, playing soccer and designing clothing. Coding is so fun and challenging because i get to creates a set of instructions for computers to follow, to determine what actions a computer can and cannot take. I find technology innovating and so cool because there's so many aspects to it and there's limitless possibilities. I love playing soccer so much because it's my favorite sport when i was growing up. As i grow up, my music taste has gotten better and better as i discover more artists, different genres and music. Another interest of mind is designing clothing, different graphics on t-shirts and hoodies like anime and various patterns.
